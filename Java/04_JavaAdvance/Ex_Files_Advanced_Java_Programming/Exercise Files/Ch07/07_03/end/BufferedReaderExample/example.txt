The holidays are over, and we’ve bounced into the new year with rejuvenation – setting our own resolutions that will (hopefully) spark us to make this our best year yet! And while I applaud efforts to lose weight, save money, or fulfill other resolutions you’ve set for yourself, I encourage you to make this year the best one yet for your pet, too. Your pet can’t tell you what his or her resolutions are, but here are a few ideas for resolutions you can set to increase happiness for your pet in the new year.

 

Evaluate your pet’s dietary needs. Eating better is a very common new year’s resolution, and there’s no reason it should only apply to you. Our pets deserve the very best we can give. As your pet ages, his or her dietary needs change, too. Take a look at what you’re serving them and make sure that it is still appropriate for their age, and current state of health. Review the nutritional content of the treats you’re providing as well. Also, consider fresh fruits and vegetables, that are healthy for them – they can be alternatives to traditional processed treats. The truth is that if they eat better, the will be healthier in the long run too!
Make exercise a part of your pet’s daily routine. Keeping your pet active, and making sure that they are exercising can be beneficial to both of you. Whether it’s playtime with a toy, going for a walk, or playing ball – take some extra time to make sure that your pet gets the exercise they need.
Create play dates with your pet. We usually have plenty of interactions throughout our day, but our pets typically rely on us to provide them with interaction. Think about it, as far as they are concerned, we are their best friend! Take your pooch to the dog park, or create a nighttime routine of play with your feline friend. Commit to specific play times every week with your pet. Not only will they love it, but it’s sure to be good for you as well.
Maintain healthy habits. Grooming your pet can be a difficult and sometimes agonizing process. However, if you make it a habit, they will adjust to it and it will get easier. Periodontal disease is a precursor to a whole host of pet issues, including heart, liver, and kidney disease. Brushing your pet’s teeth regularly can keep dental issues at bay. Daily or weekly grooming (depending on your pet and their specific needs) might seem daunting, but preventing matted hair will reduce skin irritations, pain, and stress. Trimmed nails keep your pet’s feet healthy and prevent walking issues. These are just a few of the things you can do to create healthy habits for your pet. Remember that things like regular checkups and parasite prevention are important too.
