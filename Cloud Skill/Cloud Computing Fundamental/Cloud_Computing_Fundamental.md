# Cloud Computing Fundamentals: Cloud Concepts

## 1. Course Overview

## 2. Cloud Principles

### 2.1 Introduce to Cloud Computing

**Cloud computing** 

The technology which is Internet based and represented as a cloud graphic.

**Cloud Services**

e.g. Gmail / Netflix / Salesforce



### 2.2 Cloud vs. On-premise

**On-premise** 内部部署

- Hardware (Processor, memory, hard drive, etc.)
- Operating System (Integrated with hardware)
- Applications

**Why Cloud computing?**

- 更多的需求，导致了购买硬件和电子设备成本上涨；同时，还需要协同软件版本更新，系统兼容的问题。使得云计算，成为了更高效的选择。

**Cloud Computing**

- Renting computing resources
- Flexibility and scalability
- Access to latest technologies
- Enterprise-level data protection
- Reduced IT staff and admin costs

**Technology Pillars of Cloud Computing**  云计算的支柱

- ==Virtualization==: Not a one-to-one relationship between a physical server and a logical server

- ==Hypervisor==: Allows multiple OSs to share the same host, and manage the resource allocation to virtual OSs.

  > 它允许多个操作系统共享同一个主机，并管理虚拟操作系统的资源分配。



### 2.3 Cloud Service Models

**Models**

- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) = Virtual hardware, replace physical on premise IT infrastructure.
- Platform as a Service (PaaS) = Add feature to *IaaS*, like OS, software development tools and IDE.
- Software as a Service (SaaS) 

**Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)** 

- Virtual hardware ---X---> physical one
- Scale up or down based on needs. 可扩展性
- Pay for what you use
- 物联网 (Internet of Things IoT )的动力
- High-performance computing
- Data storage, backup and recovery

Covers 3 aspects

- Compute: 按需提供计算资源
- Block Storage：提供可用于存储信息的块
- Network：提供网络能力所需的资源

**Platform as a Service (PaaS) **

- OSs and software
- Runtime environments
- Allows developers to focus on app
- Provisioning and deployment
- Load balancing and autoscaling
- APIs, DevOps, Integration and ML

Covers 3 Aspects

- Object storage = providing resources on how object are stored.
- Identity = 提供一个处理用户身份验证的层
- Runtime = 为应用程序运行提供了运行时层
- Queue = 用于批处理和消息处理
- Database 

**Software as a Service (SaaS)** 

- Apps are accessed over Internet
- largest of the three models
- Monthly or yearly subscription fee
- Internet connection is required
- Biggest concern is data security

Cover Aspects

- Monitoring
- Content
- Collaboration
- Communication
- Finance

**Other Models**

- Business Processes (BPaaS)  = 工资单，IT帮助或者其他服务等流程业务
- Communications (CaaS) = 提供IP
- Machine Learning (MLaaS)
- Databases (DBaaS) = out-of-box db of sql/nosql
- Funcitons (FaaS)
